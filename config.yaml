# =============================================================================
# Memo Automator Configuration
# =============================================================================
# Adjust these settings for each project / proforma-memo pair.

# --- Proforma settings ---
proforma:
  # Which Excel tabs to extract data from (order doesn't matter)
  tabs:
    - "Executive Summary"
    - "Development Summary"
    - "Cash Flow"
    - "Assumptions"
    - "Proforma Comparison"

  # Maximum rows to read per tab (0 = read all rows).
  # Keeps API payload manageable; 250 is usually more than enough.
  max_rows_per_tab: 250

  # Maximum columns to read per tab (0 = read all columns).
  max_cols_per_tab: 20

# --- Memo settings ---
memo:
  # Pages to scan for metrics. Use "all" to scan every slide in the deck,
  # or provide a list of specific page numbers, e.g. [3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12].
  pages: "all"

# --- Claude API settings ---
claude:
  # Model for Step 4 (metric mapping). Sonnet is fast and accurate for
  # identifying which memo values map to which proforma cells.
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-6"

  # Model for Step 5 (QA validation). Opus with adaptive thinking catches
  # subtle errors that Sonnet might miss (formatting, false matches).
  # Set to same as model above to use a single model for both steps.
  validation_model: "claude-sonnet-4-6"

  # Max tokens for the API response.
  # Dense table pages (cash flow, dev budget) can produce 30K+ chars of JSON.
  max_tokens: 64000

  # Temperature (0 = deterministic; recommended for financial data).
  temperature: 0
